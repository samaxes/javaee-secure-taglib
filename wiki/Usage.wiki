= Taglib reference =

First of all you have to reference the taglib in your JSP. Here's an example:
{{{
<%@ taglib uri="http://samaxes.com/taglibs/secure" prefix="secure" %>
}}}


= Secure content =

Next you can evaluate the nested body content of the tag to check if the user has the roles which grant him access to view its content.

Some examples:
{{{
<secure:one roles="role1toevaluate, role2toevaluate">
    Show this content if the user has one of the specified roles.
</secure:one>
}}}

{{{
<secure:all roles="role1toevaluate, role2toevaluate">
    Show this content if the user has all the specified roles.
</secure:all>
}}}

{{{
<secure:none roles="role1toevaluate, role2toevaluate">
    Show this content if the user has none of the specified roles.
</secure:none>
}}}
